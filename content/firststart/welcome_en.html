            <h2>Previously released updates</h2>

            <h3>Send PDF documents via Fax</h3>
            <p>Need to fax a PDF document to someone without delay? It doesn't get much easier than this: Simply click on the sipgateFFX logo in your browser and then select "Send PDF as Fax" to bring up the pop-up window. Browse for your PDF file and then send it off!. If required, you can also define a date and time for when the fax should be sent. This feature is available to both sipgate plus and team customers.</p>

            <h3>Selection of the sender’s number for the sending of text messages </h3>

                Choose the sender's number of your text message, and then determine which device you wish to receive answers to your message.  
            </p>
            <h3>Disabling sipgateFFX on certain websites</h3>
            <p>
				In certain cases, sipgateFFX might mistake account numbers or sort codes, for phone numbers, this might result in sipgateFFX marking these entries with the Click2Dial phone icon. To avoid this from occuring, you can disable the Click2Dial function on such websites. This might come in handy when you are using online banking for example.            	
            </p>
            <h3>Phone number recognition is now even better!</h3>
            <p>
            	Click2Dial’s phone number recognition has been improved even further, especially for US phone numbers. False recognition has been reduced to a minimum. 
            </p>
            <h3>Team Customers can even set their DND-Status</h3>
            <p>
				With the new version of sipgateFFX, sipgate team customers can rely on the DND-function to mute all phones, this might come in handy, the customer may not want to receive calls between certain times, for example. When the DND feature is activated, callers get a busy signal. 
            </p>
            <h3>Full menus for sipgate basic and plus-customers</h3>
            <p>

            <h2>sipgateFFX – The Features </h2>
            <p>
            	With just one click on the sipgate symbol in the statuslist of your browser, the contextmenu opens, giving you instant access to all the available features. In the upper pane, you can credit your account, retrieve voicemails, view your contacts, itemized billing, view your call list, as well as send/retrieve faxes (exclusive to sipgate plus), send a text message or pay a visit to the sipgate online shop. After clicking on the respective area, a new browser window or tab will open. In the area next to settings, you will see the Click2Dial feature. Recognising and calling phone numbers on websites is made so easy with sipgateFFX. In addition to the displayed phone number is a phone icon. If you click it, a new window appears that displays the status of the connection. When your phone rings, you choose whether the connection should be established or not. Once you pick up your phone, you will be connected to the number you rang from your web browser! By clicking on cancel in the Status window, the connection can be cancelled.
